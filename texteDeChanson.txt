Hello world, this is me
Life should be fun for everyone

Life is easy if you wear a smile
Just be yourself don't ever change your style
You are you, I am me, we'll be free

Hello world, this is me
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello world, come and see
This is me

Come on Baby, don't be afraid
Come on Baby, It's not too late
Say you do, won't you open up the door and let me in

Hello world, this is me
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello world, come and see
Life should be, fun for everyone

Every now and then I'm insecure
Let me show you life can be so pure
Seize the day, wear a big happy smile upon your face

Look into my eyes and tell me straight
For you I'll make the whole world wait
Let me know, if it's so, let it show

Hello world, this is me
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello world, come and see
This is me

Come on Baby, don't be afraid
Come on Baby, It's not too late
Say you do, won't you open up the door and let me in

Hello world, this is me
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello world, come and see
Life should be, fun for everyone
Fun for you, just fun for me, yeah
Fun for everyone
Hello world, this is me
Life should be, fun for everyone
